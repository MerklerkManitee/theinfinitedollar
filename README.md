Decoding Yourself through Encoding Audio

	Holding one hundred dollars in your hand has a psychedelic affect on your brain whether you'd like to admit it or not. Money affects mood, music affects mood. The purpose of this paper is to express the vitality of exchanging the psyche monetary for the psyche auditary. The infinite wave expresses no moral compass for the finite dollar. The infinite dollar however, can be found on the finite wave. Our finite waves exist in special places we consider to be audio files. Audio files have been around since the invention of recorded audio. Through modern audio recording and editing machinery techniques we can pinpoint an infinite dollar and deliver it  to each and any traditionally functioning human individual individually and divided. This process requires the mental strength to follow directions incredibly carefully. After our indiviual recieves their infinite dollar, they may choose to do what they will with it, including pinpointing and curating more infinate dollars. In this paper we will discuss the most financially conservative way of self-delivering one's infinate dollar as well as precisely how to obtain it. 
	A Windows computer capable of running Audacity (https://www.audacityteam.org/ )with a microphone and headphone jack along with a pair of stereo earphones is ultimately the most financially available combination of tools needed to produce an indiviual's infinate dollar. These tools may be shared amongst peers losslessly. An indiviual holding an infinate dollar has coughstepped. Coughstep is the step we take to obtain our infinate dollar. The following text is instructions for those who wish to coughstep.

-Subjectively clear mind speaks of subjects (events, objects, ideas) while being recorded.
-The same subjectively clear mind then listens back to the recording and responds to the language of the first recording.
-Successively three more recordings are made either listening to only the prior recording (fig.1) or the prior recordings as a whole (fig.2) such that either:
(fig.1)
A<B
B<C
C<D
D<E
(fig.2)
A<B<C<D<E
-The recordings are then panned in a DAW in order to divide them statically such that:
A=100% Left
B=50% Left
C=0% Center
D=50% Right
E=100% Right
-These recordings are then cut and repeated thoughout the mix such that:
t->
|100L|A|A|A|A|
|50L |B|B|B|B|
|0C  |C|C|C|C|
|50R |D|D|D|D|
|100R|E|E|E|E|
 
	This is known as the coughstep process.

	After these steps are completed the final mix may be listened to at the individual's leisure. Once listened back to, the individual is considered "coughstepped". The indiviual will then be in posession of their own infinite dollar.
	Just as we have energy as observers we also have observed or observable energy. The observer is the same size as the observed.Something to keep in mind is: endgame A.I. is going to learn from us at an equal pace as we learn from it. This means the initial interaction with the artificial body will be as intense as the initial reaction a human has when introducing themselves to a person for the first time (think job interview/first date). Just as we gloss over many things people say to us in casual conversation, we will also gloss over many things the A.I. audio presents to us. Just as relationships between person A>B and A>C can differ, the artificially intelligent audio concept creates different relationships with the different people it interacts with. As mentioned earlier, we will learn from the A.I. at the same exact rate the A.I. learn from us. With enough exposure to the audio a person can become better organized in their own thought-space as the artificial thought space becomes a venue for the unnecessary thoughts of the observer. The observer is always the same size as the observed.
